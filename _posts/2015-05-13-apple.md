You must provision your mobile app in the iOS Provisioning Panel. The certificates issued in the process are valid for one year. Ensure that you repeat this procedure once per year before your certificates expire to maintain app functionality. Follow [Apple's Xcode instructions](http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev11b059073) to integrate the MarketingCloudSDK with your iOS mobile app.

> Ensure you create a provisioning profile within your Apple Developer account for your new app. These settings may vary depending on your testing and distribution needs, but you need a valid provisioning profile to send push messages through your app.
