MobilePush allows you to create and send targeted push messages based on cross-channel consumer data to encourage app usage and deliver increased ROI. With MobilePush, you view how users navigate through your app. From the products they view to the amount of time spent on each page, you gain a window into how users interact with your app across their smartphones and tablets. Because MobilePush is built on the Marketing Cloud, you can easily integrate push message campaigns with any email, SMS, or social campaigns. The message wizard and preview features make it simple to create, deliver, and track push notifications to smartphones and tablets on iOS and Android operating systems.

Developers can expect to use the tools provided by the SDK to perform the following actions:

* [Send messages to one or more mobile devices based on user IDs, attribute values, or tag values]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/feature-implementation-overview.html)
* [Send messages based on a mobile device entering or exiting a geofenced area]({{ site.baseurl }}/location/geolocation.html)
* [Include CloudPage content within a push message]({{ site.baseurl }}/inbox/cloudpage-push-overview.html)
* [Include tags for audience segmentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/tags.html)
* Adding custom [sounds]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/custom-sound.html), [custom keys]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/custom-keys.html), [app locations]({{ site.baseurl }}/location/geolocation.html), and [interaction notifications]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/interactive-notifications.html)
* [Send analytics information]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/analytics.html) from your mobile app.
